Ecommerce Project (Ready-to-run)

Instructions:
1. Move the 'ecommerce_project' folder into your XAMPP/htdocs (or equivalent) directory.
2. Import 'database/ecommerce_db.sql' into phpMyAdmin to create the database and sample data.
3. Ensure php.ini allows file uploads and sessions.
4. Access the site at: http://localhost/ecommerce_project/index.php
5. Admin panel: http://localhost/ecommerce_project/admin/admin_login.php
   - Default admin: admin / admin123

Notes:
- db_connect.php uses root with no password. Change if your MySQL has a password.
- The project uses FPDF for PDF exports. If you need PDF exports, add the FPDF library to php/fpdf/.
